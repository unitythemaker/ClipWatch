# Clipwatch
A basic clipboard watcher made with xclip. I needed to access the clipboard history sometimes and I use [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/). So made a basic bash script.

To use it I recommend you to copy these 2 bash scripts into /usr/local/bin/ then add an alias as you like to make the command shorter. Then add ``clipwatch`` command to your autostart script.
